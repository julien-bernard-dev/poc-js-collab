This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app :   
**npm (or npx) create-react-app client**   

Then some components were added with the following npm command :  
**npm install styled-components react-table react-router-dom axios bootstrap --save**    

Components added to react skeleton :     
- styled-components (to add actual css directly from react component)   
- react-table (lightweight table for react)   
- react-router-dom (to bind http logical routes to react components)   
- axios (http/promise client base to consume our mongo http api)   
- bootstrap (some fine stylish tuning)   
    
To run the application, enter the commande npm start.   
Project built and run with Nodejs 10.
